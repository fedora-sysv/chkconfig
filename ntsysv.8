.SH NAME
ntsysv \- simple interface for configuring runlevels
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBntsysv\fR [\fB--root\fR \fIpath\fR] [--back] [--level <levels>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBntsysv\fR is a simple interface for configuring runlevel services which
are also configurable through \fBchkconfig\fR. By default, it configures
runlevels 2, 3, 4, and 5. If the user would like to configure other runlevels,
those levels can be specified on the command line by listing the levels
after \fB--level\fR, without any spaces. For example, the option
\fI--level 016\fR edits runlevels 0, 1, and 6.

A service is considered to be started in the runlevel set if it is started
in any of the runlevels which are being edited.

The \fBntsysv\fR window normally contains a \fBCancel\fR button. If
\fB--back\fR is specified, a \fBBack\fR button appears instead.

\fB-\-root \fIpath\fR is given, uses alternative root path when looking 
for unit files same as by \fBsystemctl\fR.

.PD
.SH "RETURN CODES"
\fBntsysv\fR returns 0 on success, 2 on error, and 1 if the user cancelled
(or backed out of) the program.
